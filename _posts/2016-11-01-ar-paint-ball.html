<p>Teaching assistant is a tough job..</p>
<p>And the video above is an AR assignment basecode/demo I created as teaching assistant for CIS568-Game Design Practicum at UPenn. The concept is use the phone as a paint gun and PC screen as canvas. I used Vuforia AR plugin and Photon networking plugin with Unity, and combined inputs from camera and gyroscope.</p>
